# Changelog

All notable changes to the "Gently" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- Fixed `XXHash64` state leak in `EmbeddingCache` by re-instantiating on each digest.
- Fixed `hnswlib-node` initialization parameters to match v3.0.0 API.
- Fixed `tsc` build errors by properly excluding maintenance scripts and reproduction files.
- Fixed outdated links and paths in `README.md`.

### Added
- Centralized `GentlyError` class for robust error handling.
- Centralized `OutputChannel` logging for better observability.
- `optionalDependencies` for native modules with graceful fallback to lexical search.
- Rate-limiting and execution timeouts for Guardian background tasks.
- `tsconfig.scripts.json` for separate script maintenance.

### Removed
- `compile_errors.txt` (legacy build artifact).
- `netlify.toml` (redundant web config).
- `repro_hnsw.js` and `repro_xxhash.js` (debug scripts).
